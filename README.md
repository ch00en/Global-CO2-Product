Global Multi-source Satellite Data Fusion (2015~2021) CO2 Concentration Products
## Source of dataset
This dataset was generated by this study based on four satellites, OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT, and GOSAT-2, and the fusion of multi-source satellite data using the local random forest model.
## Content
The dataset contains high-coverage, high-precision CO2 concentration products on a global scale for the period from 2015 to 2021. The dataset is organized in spatial and temporal resolution, with corresponding CO2 concentration values provided for each month and spatial location.
## Data processing methods
In this project, multi-source satellite data were fused using a local random forest model. The model combines multiple satellite data sources and uses local features for CO2 concentration estimation and fusion by building a local random forest model.
## Data format
The data files are stored in tif format, and each file corresponds to one month's average CO2 concentration data. The file naming format is YYYYMM.tif, e.g. 202001.tif indicates the global monthly average CO2 concentration in January 2020.
